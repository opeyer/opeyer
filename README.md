👋 Hi, I’m @opeyer!
👀 I’m interested in full-stack web development, machine learning, information security, Linux, virtualization, and more.
🌱 I’m currently learning about HTML and CSS, Proxmox, Debian, Python, and, similarly, more! I'm also dabbling in writing.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing just yet, but when my skills get where they need to be, get at me!
📫 You can always email me at opeyer [at] gmail [dot] com.
