👋 Hi, I’m @opeyer! <br />
👀 I’m interested in full-stack web development, machine learning, information security, Linux, virtualization, and more. <br />
🌱 I’m currently learning about HTML and CSS, Proxmox, Debian, Python, and, similarly, more! I'm also dabbling in writing. <br />
💞️ If you have any ideas for collaboration, get at me. I'm always down for working together on something.<br />
📫 You can always email me at opeyer [at] gmail [dot] com.
