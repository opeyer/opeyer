👋 Hi, I’m @opeyer! <br />
👀 I’m interested in full-stack web development, machine learning, information security, Linux, virtualization, and much, much more. <br />
🌱 I’m currently focusing on my CCNA, but I am doing a bit of dabbling in full-stack web development on the side. <br />
💞️ If you have any ideas for collaboration, get at me. I'm always down for working together on something. <br />
📫 You can always send me a holler at opeyer [at] gmail [dot] com.
